<h1>Downloading Who's On First</h1>

<p>At rest every Who's On First record is an atomic GeoJSON-encoded text file. This decision addresses concerns about the portability and longevity of the project but can make it a challenge to get started. For that reason we provide a variety of pre-packaged distributions, in a number of formats, of Who's On First data organized by placetype and country.</p>

<p>All of these distributions are available from:</p>
  
<p style="font-size:2em; text-align:center;font-weight:700;"><a href="https://dist.whosonfirst.org/">https://dist.whosonfirst.org/</a></p>

<h2 id="distributions">Distributions</h2>

<p>In order to talk about distributions we need to take a moment to talk about how the raw data is stored and organized. <em>If you haven't already read the <a href="#repos">How the Who's On First data repositories are organized</a> section below, now would be a good time to take a look because its informs how we are currently building the distributions listed here. Go ahead, we'll wait...</em></p>

<p>Eventually we will have a variety of smaller data distributions grouped by country and placetype and other properties, but as of this writing all distributions are derived from individual repositories in the <a href="">whosonfirst-data</a> GitHub organization.</p>

<h3 id="sqlite">SQLite databases</h3>

<p>Who's On First data exported as a set of SQLite database tables: ancestors, concordances, geojson, geometries, names, spr (which is an acronym for "<a href="/docs/spr/">standard places response</a>").</p>

<p>SQLite databases are available from:</p>

<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li><a href="https://dist.whosonfirst.org/sqlite/">https://dist.whosonfirst.org/sqlite/</a></li>
</ul>

<small>SQLite databases are generated using the <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-sqlite">go-whosonfirst-sqlite</a> package.</small>

<h3 id="bundles">"Bundles"</h3>

<p>"Bundles" are basically Who's On First Git repositories without the <code>.git</code> directories (because they often very large and of little use to people who just want to work with the raw data).</p>

<p>Bundles are available from:</p>
  
<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li><a href="https://dist.whosonfirst.org/bundles/">https://dist.whosonfirst.org/bundles/</a></li>
</ul>

<small>Bundles are generated using the <a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-bundles">go-whosonfirst-bundles</a> package.</small>

<h3 id="shapefiles">Shapefiles</h3>

<p style="font-style:italic;">Shapefile distributions are not yet available but will be soon.</p>

<h2 id="github">Git(Hub)</h2>

<p>All the Who's On First data and its complete edit history is available on GitHub:</p>
  
<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/">https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="repos">How the Who's On First data repositories are organized</h2>

<p>We use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> version control system to manage Who's On First data. One of the present-day limits of Git is the number of atomic files you can store in a single Git "repository". We believe that eventually it will be possible to keep all 26 million records in a single Git repository but we are not there yet.</p>

<p>Instead of a single monolithic repository we have grouped Who's On First data as follows:</p>

<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li><a href="#administrative-data">Administrative Data</a> - all administrative placetypes (all the places between and inclusive of continents to microhoods) for the entire world</li>
  <li><a href="#other-data">Everything else</a> - all other placetypes including venues, postalcodes, constituencies and intersections</li>
</ul>

<p>The naming convention for Who's On First data reposiories at its <em>most granular</em> looks like this:</p>

<pre>
	<code>whosonfirst-data + "-" + WHOSONFIRST_PLACETYPE + "-" + WHOSONFIRST_COUNTRY + "-" + WHOSONFIRST_SUBDIVISION</code>
</pre>

<p>There are some important points to keep in mind about these conventions:</p>

<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li>All administrative data is stored in the <code>whosonfirst-data</code> repository. Administrative data is <em>not</em> subdivided by country or placetype.</li>
  <li>We try to use the shortest name whenever possible. The only reason for subdiving a placetype by country (or a country by subdivision) is to address operational concerns of working with the data in Git or GitHub.</li>
  <li>As a general rule every Who's On First document <em>should</em> have both an explicit <code>wof:repo</code> property containing the name of its parent repository.</li>
  <li>Who's On First documents should also contain all the necessary properties to reconstruct its <code>wof:repo</code> name allowing developers to validate that name by testing for the presence of a matching repository, starting with the most granular name and working backwards.</li>
  <li>The Who's On First data model allows for all of these repositories to be merged in to a single tree stucture without any collisions. If a Who's On First record is accidentally stored in or saved to an inappropriate repository that is considered an inconvenience (to be fixed) but not an error.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="administrative-data">Administrative Data</h3>

<p>Administrative data is located in the whosonfirst-data repository. This repository contains all administrative placetypes (all the places between and inclusive of continents to microhoods) for the entire world.</p>

<p>You can find data for the following placetypes in the whosonfirst-data repository: continent, empire, country, macroregion, region, macrocounty, county, locality, macrohood, neighbourhood, microhood</p>

<ul class="downloads-list">

</ul>

<h3 id="other-data">Other Data</h3>

<h4 id="venue">Venues</h4>

<p>There are over 20 million venues in Who's On First, with about 60% in the USA. Venues in the USA are grouped in to <code>whosonfirst-data-venue-us-{WHOSONFIRST_SUBDIVISION}</code> repositories, while everything is grouped in to <code>whosonfirst-data-venue-{WHOSONFIRST_COUNTRY}</code> repositories.</p>

<p>There is also a general purpose <code>whosonfirst-data-venue</code> repository which contains no data but pointers to all the venue-related repositories that do:</p>

<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-venue/">https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-venue</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="postalcode">Postal Codes</h4>

<p>Postal codes are grouped in to <code>whosonfirst-data-postalcode-{WHOSONFIRST_COUNTRY}</code> repositories.</p>

<p>There is also a general purpose <code>whosonfirst-data-postalcode</code> repository which contains no data but pointers to all the postal code -related repositories that do:</p>

<ul class="downloads-list">
  <li><a href="https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-postalcode">https://github.com/whosonfirst-data/whosonfirst-data-postalcode</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="consituency">Constituencies</h4>

<p>Constituencies are available for only a select number of countries (two to be exact: the USA and Canada) as we work through what it means to include constituencies in Who's On First. <em>If you have constituencies from other countries we'd love to include them too.</em></p>

</ul>

<h4 id="intersections">Intersections</h4>

<p>Intersections are a still-experimental placetype in Who's On First, currently only available for New York City (and specifically Manhattan).</p>
